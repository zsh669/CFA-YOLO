This project is based on YOLOv5 version 7.0 and incorporates MSCA and CBAM. Here are a few important points to note:
1.	For ease of coding, MSCA in the paper is referred to as C3R in this project, and CBAM is referred to as CBAMC3.
2.	The weight files in the training results cannot be uploaded using git because they are more than 100M. If you need it, please contact us at 1025140179@qq.com.
3.	Due to GitHub limitations, the rebar image dataset cannot be uploaded. If needed, please contact via email: 1025140179@qq.com.
4.	There may be some issues with the first file upload. If you encounter any problems, feel free to contact me via the email above. Thank you very much.

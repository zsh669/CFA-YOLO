This project is based on YOLOv5 version 7.0 and incorporates MSCA and CBAM. Here are a few important points to note:
1.	For ease of coding, MSCA in the paper is referred to as C3R in this project, and CBAM is referred to as CBAMC3.
2.	The training results have been uploaded to a different branch Models. Specific hyperparameters can be referenced from the paper or the training results. The project training and validation commands have also been uploaded, and you can refer to the python.txt file for details. Please make sure to configure the environment before running.
